- RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. It provides one core type, the [Observable](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/observable), satellite types (Observer, Schedulers, Subjects) and operators inspired by **`Array`** methods (map, filter, reduce, every, etc) to allow handling asynchronous events as collections.
- ReactiveX combines the [Observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) with the [Iterator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern) and [functional programming with collections](http://martinfowler.com/articles/collection-pipeline/#NestedOperatorExpressions) to fill the need for an ideal way of managing sequences of events.
- The essential concepts in RxJS which solve async event management are:

	- **Observable:** represents the idea of an invokable collection of future values or events.
	- **Observer:** is a collection of callbacks that knows how to listen to values delivered by the Observable.
	- **Subscription:** represents the execution of an Observable, is primarily useful for cancelling the execution.
	- **Operators:** are pure functions that enable a functional programming style of dealing with collections with operations like map, filter, concat, reduce, etc.
	- **Subject:** is equivalent to an EventEmitter, and the only way of multicasting a value or event to multiple Observers.
	- **Schedulers:** are centralized dispatchers to control concurrency, allowing us to coordinate when computation happens on e.g. `setTimeout` or `requestAnimationFrame` or others.
