15. **DevOps building block: Agile**
	- Manifesto for Agile Software Development
		We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
		Through this work we have come to value:
		- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
		- Working software over comprehensive documentation
		- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
		- Responding to change over following a plan
		That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
	- Waterfall Model to Agile Model

16. **DevOps building block: Lean**
	- Seven Principles of Lean Software
		1. Eliminate waste.
		2. Amplify learning.
		3. Decide as late as possible.
		4. Decide as fast as possible.
		5. Empower the team.
		6. Build in integrity.
		7. See the whole.
	- Three types of waste that Lean recognizes:
		1. Muda: Work that absorbs resources, but adds no value
		2. Muri: Unreasonable work imposed on workers and machines
		3. Mura: Work coming in unevenly instead of a constant or regular flow
	- Forms of waste:
		1. Partially done work
		2. Extra features
		3. Relearning
		4. Handoffs
		5. Delays
		6. Task switching
		7. Defects
	- Build, Measure, Learn:
		1. Build the minimum viable product.
		2. Measure the outcome and internal metrics.
		3. Learn about your problem and your solution.
		4. Repeat. Go deep where it's needed.
	- DevOps principle changed from CAMS to CALMS:
		- Culture Automation Lean Measurement Sharing
