1. **What is DevOps?**
	- "The practice of operations and development engineers participating together in the entire service lifecycle, from design through the development process to production support."
	- Different Teams for: Code -> Test -> Deploy -> Operate
	- The Five Levels of DevOps:
		1. Values
		2. Principles
		3. Methods
		4. Practices
		5. Tools
	- Teams Using DevOps Practices:
		- Deployed changes  **==30 times==** more frequently
		- Had **==200 times==** shorter lead times 
		- Experienced **==60 times==** fewer failures
		- Recovered from errors **==168 times==** faster
	- Development                  +                Operations
		-> Developers                                 -> System admins
		-> Front end                                    -> Network admins
		-> QA                                               -> Database admins
	- What DevOps is not
		- A new name for an operations team
		- A job title
		- A new tool category

2. **DevOps core values: CAMS**
	- CAMS:
		- C - Culture
		- A - Automation
		- M - Measurement
		- S - Sharing
	- "That the word DevOps gets reduced to technology is a manifestation of how badly we need a cultural shift."                  --Patrick Debois
	- Culture: About how Developer team and Operation team work together.
	- Automation: 1. People 2. Process 3. Tools
	- Measurement: All about metrics
		![[key-metrics.png]]
	- Sharing: Is a feedback that helps in continuous improvement.

3. **DevOps principles: The three ways**
	- Systems Thinking: Increasing performance and optimizations
	- Amplifying Feedback Loops: Short effective feedbacks are key factors
	- Continuous Experimentation: New Learning and experiments. Also mastering in your sills.
		- "Working code wins."
		- "If it hurts, do it more."
		- "Fail fast."
	- Use the Three Ways:
		- To create team processes
		- To create team standards
		- As part of management style

4. **Your DevOps playbook**
	- First Methodology:
		- people
		- process
		- tools
	- Second Methodology:
		- Continuous Delivery
	- Third Methodology:
		- Lean Management
			- Work in small batches
			- Work in progress limits
			- Feedback loops
			- Visualization
	- Fourth Methodology:
		- Change Control: Refer The Visible Ops Handbook by Kevin Behr, Gene Kim, and George Spafford (IT Process Institute - 2005)
		- Visible Ops-Style Change Control:
			- Eliminate fragile artifacts
			- Create a repeatable build process
			- Manage dependencies
			- Create an environment of continuous improvement
	- Fifth Methodology:
		- Infrastructure as Code
			- System treated like code
			- Checked into source control
			- Reviewed, built, and tested
			- Managed programmatically

5. **Ten practices for DevOps success: Ten through six**
	10. Incident Command System
		![[incident-command-system.png]]
	9. Developers on Call: Reduces conflicts and ease on fast continuous delivery.
	8. Public Status Pages: Eg: Server under maintenance!!
	7. Blameless Postmortems
	6. Embedded Teams

6. Ten practices for DevOps success: Five through one5
	5. The Cloud: Controlled Infrastructure
	4. Andon Cords: Hold up and inform when something goes wrong
	3. Dependency Injection: Dependencies should be passed in applications during runtime.
	2. Blue/Green Deployment: Setup a different server to keep the product up and running until another server is up.
	1. Chaos Monkey: Making sure their infrastructures are always on.

7. DevOps tools: The cart or horse?
	- Tool Criteria:
		1. Programmable
		2. Verifiable
		3. Well Behaved: Developers and Operations POV
