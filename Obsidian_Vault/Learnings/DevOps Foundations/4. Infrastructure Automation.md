	- Apps -> DB -> Servers -> SAN -> Network
	- Cattle, not pets

20. **Golden image to foil ball**
	- Provisioning: Making a server ready for operation, including hardware, OS, system services, and network connectivity.
	- Deployment: Automatically deploying and upgrading applications on a server.
	- Orchestration: Performing coordinated operations across multiple systems.
	- Configuration Management: Management of change control for system configuration after initial provision; maintaining and upgrading the application and its dependencies.
	- Imperative(Procedural): Commands necessary to produce a desired state are defined and executed.
	- Declarative(Functional): A desired state is defined, relying on the tool to configure a system to match that state.
	- Idempotent: The ability to execute repeatedly, resulting in the same outcome.
	- Self-Service: The ability for an end user to initiate a process without having to go through other people.
	- Source Control:
		- Provision: CFEngine -> Puppet -> Chef
		- Deploy: Capistrano -> (Ad hoc code)
