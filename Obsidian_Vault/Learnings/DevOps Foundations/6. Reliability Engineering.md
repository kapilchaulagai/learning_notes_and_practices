30. **Engineering doesn't end with deployment**
	- Reliability: The ability of a system or component to function under stated conditions for a specified period of time.
	- Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR): How quickly a service can recover from a disruption and restore service.
	- Mean Time between Failures (MTBF): The average time between service disruptions.

31. **Design for operations: Theory**
32. **Design for operations: Practice**
	- All system fails.
33. **Operate for design: Metrics and monitoring**
	- How Complex Systems Fail
		- Change introduces new forms of failure
		- Complex systems contain changing mixtures of failures latent within them
		- All complex systems are always running in degraded mode
	- Lean Approach:
		1. Build
		2. Measure
		3. Learn
		4. Repeat
	1. Service Performance and Uptime
	2. Software Component Metrics
	3. System Metrics
	4. App Metrics
	5. Performance
		- APM - application performance management
		- RUM - real user monitoring
	6. Security
		- System Security
		- Application Security
		- Custom application events
		- Anomalies

34. **Operate for design: Logging**
	- Five Ws of Logging:
		- What happened?
		- When did it happen?
		- Where did it happen?
		- Who was involved?
		- Where did that entity come from?
	- Centralized Logging
		1. Don't collect log data you won't use.
		2. Keep logs for as long as they can be used.
		3. Alert only on what you must respond to.
		4. Don't exceed business security needs.
		5. Logs change.

35. **Your SRE toolchain**
	- Software as a Service Monitoring
		- Pingdom
		- Datadog
		- Netuitive
		- Ruxit
		- Librato
		- New Relic
		- AppDynamics
	- Open-Source Monitoring
		- StatsD
		- Ganglia
		- Graphite
		- Grafana
		- InfluxDB
		- OpenTSDB
		- Dropwizard Metrics

36. Chapter Quiz:
	1. Suppose your company is going to purchase a security monitoring tool. How should you select a security monitoring tool?
		Answer: It should match and integrate well with your system and should be functional when you launch new applications.
	2. Which type of software requirement is covered by reliability engineering?
		Answer: nonfunctional
	3. Which tool would you need to deploy to prevent cascading outages?
		Answer: a circuit breaker
	4. Which technique allows you to purposely kill a server in order to test the resiliency of a system?
		Answer: deliberate adversity
	5. You are examining packets to determine whether your database is protected against SQL injections. Which type of monitoring is this?
		Answer: security
	6. Which type of items should you avoid having in your logs?
		Answer: errors that do not require action
