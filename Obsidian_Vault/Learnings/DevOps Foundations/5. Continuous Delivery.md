24. **Small + Fast = Better**
	-  Continuous Delivery
	- Continuous Integration: Automatically building and unit testing the entire application.
	- Continuous Deployment: After testing every change, automatically deploying to production.
		1. Time to market goes down.
		2. Quality increases, not decreases.
		3. This limits your work in progress.
		4. Shortens lead times for changes.
		5. Improves mean time to recover.
	- "Cease dependence on inspection to achieve quality."                 - W. Edward Deming, American engineer

 25. **Continuous Integration Practices**
	 - Cont. Integration -> Cont. Delivery -> Cont. Deployment
	 - "The goal of continuous integration is that software is in a working state all the time." - Jez Humble and Dave Farley, Continuous Delivery
	 - Practices:
		 1. Builds should pass the coffee test (less than 5 minutes).
		 2. Commit really small bits.
		 3. Don't leave the build broken.
		 4. Use a trunk-based development flow.
			 - Trunk-Based Development:
				 - No long-running branches
				 - Multiple commits each day
		5. Don't allow flaky tests. Fix them!
		6. The build should return a status, a log, and an artifact.

26. **The continuous delivery pipeline**
	1. Only build artifacts once.
	2. Artifacts should be immutable.

	3. Staging should be a copy of production.
	4. Stop deploys if a previous step fails.
	5. Deployments should be idempotent.

27. **The role of a QA**
	- Types of Testing:
		1. Unit Testing
		2. Code hygiene
			- Linting
			- Code formatting
			- Banned functions
		3. Integration testing
		4. TDD, BDD, ATDD
			- Test-driven development:
				- State desired outcome as a test
				- Write code to pass the test
				- Repeat
			- Behavior-driven development
				- Work with stakeholders
				- Describe business functionality
				- Base tests on natural language descriptions
			- Acceptance-test-driven development
				- Scenarios are from the end users' perspective
				- Use cases are the basis of automated testing
				- Testing is continuous during development
		5. Infrastructure testing
		6. Performance testing
		7. Security Testing
	
	- Dealing with slow tests:
		- Use nonblocking tests in your pipeline
		- Use time-scheduled testing (for example, nightly)
		- Use monitoring to accomplish some test 

28. **Your CI toolchain**
	1. Version Control
	2. Continuous Integration systems
	3. Build
		-  Make or Rake
		-  Maven
		- Gulp
	4. Test
		1. Unit Testing:
			- JUnit
			- Golint
			- Fofmt
			- RuboCop
		2. Integration Testing
			- Robot
			- Protractor
			- Cucumber
			- Sauce Labs
		3. Infrastructure Testing:
			- KitchenCI
			- Apache Bench
		4. Local Testing:
			- Vagrant
			- Otto
			- Docker Compose
	5. Artifact repository
		- Artifactory
		- Nexus
		- Docker Hub
	6. Deployment
		- Rundeck
		- UrbanCode
		- ThoughtWorks
		- Deployinator

29. Chapter Quiz:
	1. Which task is part of a trunk-based development flow?
		Answer: having all developers commit to the main branch frequently
	2. Which task becomes easier when code is maintained in the cloud?
		Answer: having similar preproduction and production environments
	3. If you are developing end user test scenarios, then you are engaged in which type of development?
		Answer: acceptance test-driven development
	4. Which belief has been disproven by organizations that utilize continuous delivery?
		Answer: A high frequency of change leads to a decrease in quality.
	5. What is the goal for every phase of the continuous delivery process?
		Answer: Provide early and rapid feedback
